NOTE: For all assignments, you are not allowed to modify the type signatures of the functions.

Part 1)
Download lab1.hs from the course website.
Implement the maxNum function.  This function reads in a list of numbers and returns the largest.
Define this function in a recursive manner. (Note that using the length function is cheating).


Part 2)
Implement the "fizzbuzz" game.  The function counts from 1 to the specified number, returning a
string with the result.  The rules are:

    If a number is divisible by 3 and by 5, instead say "fizzbuzz"
    Else if a number is divisible by 3, instead say "fizz"
    Else if a number is divisible by 5, instead say "buzz"
    Otherwise say the number

Here is a sample run of this function:

*Main> fizzbuzz 15
"1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz"


Part 3)
Download JSON.hs and jsonDriver.hs from the course website.

In JSON.hs, implement the JObject case of the toString function.  Compile and run jsonDriver.hs
and verify that your results look to be correct.

When you have finished, upload the assignment through Canvas (pasting in your modified programs),

If you do not have access to Canvas, submit it once you do have access (with a reminder that you
did not have access previously.
