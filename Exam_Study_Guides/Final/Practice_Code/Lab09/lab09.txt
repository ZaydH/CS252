Part 1) Functional programming in JavaScript
Download functional.js from the course website.
Implement the foldr, foldl, and map functions.
Write the curry method that we discussed in class and
use it to create a "double" function that
returns the result of multiplying the input by 2.
(Note: I know you can multiply a number by two;
the point is to use the curry method to do it).

Part 2) Object-oriented programming in JavaScript.
Create a 'Student' constructor, like we did for Cat in class.
It should have the following fields:
*firstName
*lastName
*studentID
*display -- A function that prints out the firstName, lastName, and studentID number.
      To invoke it, you should call `student.display()`.

Create an array of new students.
Add a 'graduated' property to just one of your students.

Now create another student **without** using the constructor.
(In other words, use the object literal `{}` syntax).
Set the prototype chain manually using the __proto__ field.
Make sure the display method still works (without you having to add it to the object explicitly).
