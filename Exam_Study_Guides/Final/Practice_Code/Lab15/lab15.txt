Download forwardingProxy.js from the course website.

Modify the forwarding API to log all actions taken on an object.

With this proxy, you can debug an application by wrapping an object in a proxy and tracing its behavior.

If you have extra time, explore the ECMAScript standard version of the API: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy.  (Currently, only Firefox supports this version).
