Download chatServer.js from the course website.

Run the code from the command line:
$ node chatServer.js

Open two more command line prompts, and telnet to port 9000 on each.
Whatever you type in one window will be displayed in the other.

IF YOU ARE ON WINDOWS, USE PUTTY (http://www.putty.org/).

Extend the code from the chat server example to add support for the following features:
1) Typing '\list' will list the names of all other users.
2) Typing '\rename <newname>' will let the user specify a new name for himself/herself.
3) Typing '\private <name> <msg>' will send a message only to the specified user.
