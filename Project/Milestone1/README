Project Title: "HamSkill: Run Haskell Anywhere with ANTLR and Scala"

Summary: This project takes Haskell code and converts it to Scala code.  From
there, HamSkill has two run modes.  They are:

HamSkill Standard: The primary benefit of this is that the code runs entirely
within a single Java process.  No external Scala compiler or runtime
environment is required.  Rather, it leverages Twitter's util.eval library.

To run in Hamskill Standard mode for this milestone, call:

bash hamskill_standard.sh

HamSkill+: This supports a larger set of features. However, it requires an
external Scala compiler and runtime environment.  

To run in Hamskill+ mode, call:

bash hamskill+.sh
